//Conditionals

//Conditional statements are one of the four types of procedural code: sequential, CONDITIONAL, reusable, and repetitive

//Conditional Logic

var oldEnough = true;
//Always write out the conditional statements in plain english first. This will help better understand the code you are writing or reading

//If the child is old enough, print to the console, "you can ride!"

if(oldEnough){
	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
	}//code performed if the condition is true
	
//Relational Expressions (comparing objects for decision making)
